# DESI Expansion History

This directory is to study the impact of [DESI 2024 VI](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240403002D/abstract) results on the expansion history of the Universe. To do this, we will produce four plots: Age of Universe (Gyrs and Normalized to Concordance) vs redshift and scale factor (just scale factor and Normalized to Concordance) vs lookback time.

We need five Cosmological Parameter Files: DESI+CMB, DESI+CMB+Pantheon, DESI+CMB+DESY5, DESI+CMB+Union3, Concordance.

Since we are mostly in the expansion history in redshifts of z<100, we set the negligible radiation energy density to zero.

The parameter files are in the `cosmoparams` directory. The time parameter file is `TimeParams.txt`, where we choose to use a log-space redshift domain to cover more of the scale factor space.

Since we only need information on how the expansion evolves over time, we use `TYPE=time` to compile the program used
