Keeping the same Dark Energy equation of state AND hubble param, how does varying OmegaM between 0.30 and 0.33 (in increments of 0.05) effect the scale factor plot. That is, we will have OmegaL+OmegaM=1.0 (ensuring flatness) with a table of OmegaL and OmegaM that look like

OmegaM | OmegaLambda
[0.3  , 0.7  ]
[0.305, 0.695]
[0.31 , 0.69 ]
[0.315, 0.685]
[0.32 , 0.68 ]
[0.325, 0.675]
[0.33 , 0.67 ]


filenames will be of the form
timetable_[sim]EoS_OmegaM[i].txt

where [sim] is the simulation and [i] is the bin index
